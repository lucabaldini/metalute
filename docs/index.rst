MetaLute
========

MetaLute is a (somewhat unusual) Python package aimed at supporting the design
and construction of electric guitars, and it comes as a blend of Python code,
covering several different aspects of the process, and my own personal logbook,
where I collect and organize relevant information, as I process it.

(Full disclosure: although I do have a sincere passion for guitars, I am a total
amateur at lutherie, and I am afraid this will show up.)

The very basic idea of being able to do fully parametric guitar meta-designs
admittedly comes from `Metafont <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metafont>`_,
hence the name of the package. Over time, I have been adding more and more
related items, up to the point where I myself wonder whether this is still the
right name for the package.

Anyway, feel free to look around and use anything you find useful. If you want
to get in touch with me you can drop me a line at
