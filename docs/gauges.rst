String Gauges
=============

String gauges are identified as a series of (typically 6) numbers, expressing
the thickness of each string (in inches). A *light regular* (.009"--.046") gauge,
for instance, features a 0.009 in thick high E and a 0.046 in thick low E.

The following tables summarize the basic properties for some of the most popular
electric guitar string gauges.

.. warning::
  The figures for the tension of the strings are calculated assuming the nominal
  steel density and might be slightly inaccurate, especially for wounded strings.
  (If you look for string tension calculators online, you will definitely get
  different numbers, depending on the underlying assumptions).

  Still, the tables are useful as approximate indications, and for a relative
  comparison between different gauges.
